# Documentation

You find a mix of various documentation in this directory and subdirectories,
using several different formats. Some of them are not ideal for reading
directly in your browser.

If you would rather see the rendered version of the documentation, check out the
fetch website's [documentation section](https://curl.se/docs/) for
general fetch stuff or the [libfetch section](https://curl.se/libfetch/) for
libfetch related documentation.
